## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to convert a hexadecimal value into its corresponding ASCII character.

---

## Analysis

The given value is:

```bash
0x70
```

This represents a hexadecimal number that corresponds to an ASCII character.

In ASCII encoding:

* Each hexadecimal value maps to a specific character
* `0x70` corresponds to the decimal value `112`

Looking up ASCII value `112` results in the character:

```bash
p
```

---

## Approach

We can verify this using the `xxd` command:

```bash
echo "70" | xxd -r -p
```

Output:

```bash
p
```
