## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to convert a hexadecimal (base 16) number into its decimal (base 10) equivalent.

---

## Analysis

The given value is:

```
0x3D
```

In hexadecimal:

* The digit `3` is in the 16¹ place
* The digit `D` represents 13 in decimal and is in the 16⁰ place

---

## Calculation

We compute the value as follows:

* 3 × 16 = 48
* D (13) × 1 = 13

Total:

```
48 + 13 
```

---

## Alternative Approach

You can also calculate this using the `bc` command-line tool:

```bash
echo "ibase=16; 3D" | bc
```
