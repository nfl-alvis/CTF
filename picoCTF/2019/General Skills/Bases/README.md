## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to decode the given encoded string and format the result as a picoCTF flag.

---

## Analysis

The provided string:

```
bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1
```

appears to be encoded rather than encrypted. Based on the hint referencing "bases", a strong candidate is **Base64 encoding**, which is commonly used in CTF challenges.

Characteristics of Base64:

* Uses characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, `/`
* Often ends with `=` padding (though not always required)

The given string matches the Base64 character set and structure.

---

## Approach

To decode the string, we can use the `base64` utility available in most Unix-like systems:

```bash
echo "bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1" | base64 -d
```
