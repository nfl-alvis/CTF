## Analysis

This challenge tests a fundamental concept in computer science: **number base conversion**, specifically converting a decimal number (base 10) into its binary representation (base 2).

The given value is:

```
42 (base 10)
```

The task is to determine its equivalent in binary form.

## Solution

### Method 1: Using `bc`

The `bc` (Basic Calculator) utility in Linux can perform base conversions.

Command:

```bash
echo "obase=2; 42" | bc
```

Output:

```
101010
```

---

### Method 2: Using Python

An alternative approach is to use Python’s built-in conversion function:

```bash
python3 -c "print(bin(42)[2:])"
```

Output:

```
101010
```

### Method 3: Manual Conversion

The conversion can also be performed manually by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders:

| Division | Quotient | Remainder |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| 42 ÷ 2   | 21       | 0         |
| 21 ÷ 2   | 10       | 1         |
| 10 ÷ 2   | 5        | 0         |
| 5 ÷ 2    | 2        | 1         |
| 2 ÷ 2    | 1        | 0         |
| 1 ÷ 2    | 0        | 1         |

Reading the remainders from bottom to top yields:

```
101010
```
