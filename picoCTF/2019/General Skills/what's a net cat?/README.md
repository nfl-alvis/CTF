## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to connect to a remote service using Netcat and retrieve the flag.

---

## Analysis

This challenge introduces **Netcat (`nc`)**, a versatile networking tool used to:

* Establish TCP/UDP connections
* Interact with remote services
* Debug network services
* Transfer data

The challenge provides:

* Host: `fickle-tempest.picoctf.net`
* Port: `51594`

This indicates that a service is listening on that address and port, and we need to connect to it.

## Approach

We use Netcat to establish a TCP connection to the remote server:

```bash
nc fickle-tempest.picoctf.net 51594
```
