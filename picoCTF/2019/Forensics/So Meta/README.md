## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to extract the flag hidden within the **metadata** of an image file.

---

## Analysis

The hints indicate that the flag is not embedded in the visible image content, but rather in its **metadata**.

Metadata is information stored within a file that describes its properties, such as:

* Author
* Software used
* Creation details
* Hidden comments or custom fields

To inspect metadata in image files, we can use tools like `exiftool`.

---

## Approach

We analyze the image metadata using:

```bash
exiftool pico_img.png
```

From the output, we observe that the Artist field contains the flag.
To directly extract the flag, we can filter the output:

```bash
exiftool pico_img.png | grep -o "picoCTF{.*}"
```
