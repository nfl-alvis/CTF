## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to extract hidden information from an image file using forensic analysis techniques.

---

## Analysis

The challenge suggests that the image contains hidden data. In many CTF forensics challenges, files (especially images) may include:

* Embedded strings
* Hidden metadata
* Appended data after the file structure

Instead of visually inspecting the image, we perform **static analysis** using tools like `strings`.

---

## Approach

We extract readable strings from the image and filter for the flag format:

```bash
strings garden.jpg | grep -o "picoCTF{.*}"
```

### Explanation

* `strings` extracts printable characters from the file
* `grep -o` prints only the matching portion
* `picoCTF{.*}` searches for the flag pattern
